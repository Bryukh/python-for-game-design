    "The players summon different units, they move to each other and fight.\n",

    "## 1:1 Fight\n",
    "For the fight we want to use simulation to determine the outcome of the fight. Instead of using just formulas we are building simplified game-loop. Lets say units start on opposite sides of the field. Move to each other and attacks when its possible.\n",
    "For that we need a way to save their state. For that we just use a dictionary for simplicity. This notebook covers 1:1 fight.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The current implementation and chosed data structures are not the best. But they are simple and easy to understand for first steps. The main goal is to show how to use python in game designer work. The code is not optimized and only for learning purposes."
